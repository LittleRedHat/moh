	Middle East Respiratory Syndrome<br/>
	Republic of Korea/World Health Organization<br/>
	Joint Mission<br/>
	9–13 June 2015<br/>
	EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<br/>
	On 20 May 2015, the National International Health Regulations (IHR) Focal Point of the Republic of<br/>
	Korea officially notified the World Health Organization (WHO) that a resident had developed a<br/>
	laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Domestically and<br/>
	internationally, there has been anxiety as to whether this outbreak was caused by a newly adapted<br/>
	virus strain and whether the outbreak will continue to spread, including to other countries. The<br/>
	Government of the Republic of Korea and WHO agreed to conduct a joint mission with domestic<br/>
	experts to assess the outbreak and the country’s response, and to make recommendations to strengthen<br/>
	the response and outbreak preparedness. The joint mission consisted of domestic and international<br/>
	experts in a variety of disciplines, including several with extensive experience with MERS, and was<br/>
	co-led by Dr Jong-Koo Lee and Dr Keiji Fukuda.<br/>
	The joint mission found that several factors appear to have contributed to the initial spread of the<br/>
	virus:<br/>
	• Since MERS is a new infection in the Republic of Korea, physicians and public health<br/>
	authorities did not expect it. In some instances, a travel history was not collected from cases,<br/>
	contributing to a time lag in diagnosis and isolation of cases.<br/>
	• In some hospitals, infection prevention and control measures were not optimal. Before the<br/>
	index case was diagnosed, he had contact with many people leading to spread of infection in<br/>
	three health-care facilities.<br/>
	• Certain social patterns and customs contributed to the spread of infection among several<br/>
	hospitals. For example, the practice of “doctor shopping” allowed infected patients to come in<br/>
	contact with more people than if they had stayed with one facility. The custom of having<br/>
	many friends and family members accompany or visit patients in emergency departments or<br/>
	in hospital also exposed more contacts to infection.<br/>
	The joint mission made the following initial observations:<br/>
	• There is no evidence to suggest that the MERS viruses in the Republic of Korea are<br/>
	significantly different genetically from recent viruses in the Middle East.<br/>
	• This outbreak appears similar to hospital-associated outbreaks that have occurred in the<br/>
	Middle East and does not appear to have new epidemiological features that would suggest a<br/>
	shift in how the virus is transmitted. There is no evidence of ongoing community transmission<br/>
	of MERS.<br/>
	• While the spread of MERS from the Republic of Korea to other countries remains possible,<br/>
	extensive efforts using a variety of approaches are being made to identify symptomatic and<br/>
	2<br/>
	asymptomatic individuals. Such efforts, including mandatory quarantine of close contacts,<br/>
	and restriction of international travel of all cases and contacts, are impressive and appear to be<br/>
	having an effect since incident cases are declining.<br/>
	The joint mission's recommendations to the Government were shared and discussed with the Minister<br/>
	for Health and Welfare and his staff on 13 June as follows:<br/>
	1) Infection prevention and control measures may be immediately strengthened in all health-care<br/>
	facilities in the Republic of Korea.<br/>
	2) All patients presenting with fever or respiratory symptoms may be asked about: contact with a<br/>
	MERS patient; visits to a health-care facility where a MERS patient has been treated; and<br/>
	history of travel to the Middle East 14 days before symptom onset. Any patient with positive<br/>
	responses should be promptly reported to public health authorities and managed as a<br/>
	suspected case while the diagnosis is being confirmed.<br/>
	3) Close contacts of MERS cases should not travel during the period when they are being<br/>
	monitored for the development of symptoms.<br/>
	4) Strong consideration may be given to reopening schools, as schools have not been linked to<br/>
	transmission of MERS in the Republic of Korea or elsewhere.<br/>
	5) Continued implementation of basic public health measures by all health authorities will<br/>
	contribute to stopping further cases. These measures include:<br/>
	a. early and complete identification and investigation of all contacts;<br/>
	b. robust quarantine/isolation and monitoring of all contacts and suspected cases;<br/>
	c. full implementation of infection prevention and control measures; and<br/>
	d. prevention of travel, especially internationally, of infected people and contacts.<br/>
	6) Local governments must be fully engaged and mobilized in this national emergency.<br/>
	7) In parallel with disease prevention and control measures, it is important to strengthen<br/>
	domestic and international confidence. This includes improving risk communications. The<br/>
	Ministry of Health and Welfare may provide regular updates (in Korean and English) on the<br/>
	epidemiological situation, investigations and disease control measures.<br/>
	8) Additional staff (for surge capacity) are urgently required for the response and to provide<br/>
	relief for staff working on the outbreak.<br/>
	9) Selected hospitals may be designated for safe triage and assessment of suspected MERS cases.<br/>
	This will require trained personnel, facility management and communication with the public.<br/>
	10) Comprehensive research studies designed to close critical gaps in knowledge, including seroepidemiological<br/>
	studies, may be completed and the results widely communicated as quickly<br/>
	as possible.<br/>
	11) The Republic of Korea may ensure that it is able to optimally respond to future outbreaks.<br/>
	This includes strengthening medical facilities to deal with serious infectious diseases<br/>
	(including increased numbers of negative-pressure isolation rooms), considering how to<br/>
	reduce the practice of “doctor shopping”, training more infection prevention and control<br/>

	1. INTRODUCTION<br/>
	On 20 May 2015, the National International Health Regulations (IHR) Focal Point (Korea Centers for<br/>
	Disease Control and Prevention, (KCDC)) of the Republic of Korea officially notified WHO that a<br/>
	resident had developed a laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).<br/>
	The index case had recently travelled to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain<br/>
	but had not been ill during travel.<br/>
	This was the first introduction of MERS into the Republic of Korea and has resulted in the largest<br/>
	outbreak of this infection outside the Middle East. As of 13 June 2015, there were 138 laboratoryconfirmed<br/>
	cases (including 14 deaths), all of whom appear epidemiologically linked to the index case<br/>
	or subsequent secondary cases. As of 13 June, more than 60 health-care facilities had cared for a case<br/>
	of MERS, among which six hospitals have had documented nosocomial transmission. One case<br/>
	travelled from the Republic of Korea to China by transiting through Hong Kong SAR (China).<br/>
	Information on this case was first reported by the Republic of Korea through the IHR (2005)<br/>
	mechanism. The case was then detected and reported by China.<br/>
	Within the Republic of Korea and internationally, there has been anxiety as to whether this outbreak<br/>
	was caused by a newly adapted virus strain and whether this outbreak will continue to spread,<br/>
	including to other countries.<br/>
	The Government of the Republic of Korea and WHO agreed to conduct a joint mission with domestic<br/>
	experts to assess the outbreak and the Republic of Korea's response, and to make recommendations to<br/>
	strengthen the response and outbreak preparedness. The joint mission consisted of domestic and<br/>
	international experts in a variety of disciplines, including several with extensive experience with<br/>
	MERS. The mission was co-led by Dr Jong-Koo Lee and Dr Keiji Fukuda. The missions members are<br/>
	listed in Annex 1.<br/>
	2. TERMS OF REFERENCE<br/>
	The joint mission travelled to the Republic of Korea:<br/>
	• to jointly review the current situation of the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea,<br/>
	including epidemiological patterns, virus characteristics, clinical features and public health<br/>
	response;<br/>
	• to provide technical recommendations on response measures to control the outbreak; and<br/>
	• to share experiences between the Republic of Korea and the international community in<br/>
	responding to the first significant outbreak of MERS occurring outside the Middle East.<br/>
	3. ACTIVITIES<br/>
	On the first day of the mission, the WHO team was greeted by the Minister and Vice-Minister of<br/>
	Health and Welfare. The joint team established a working base at KCDC and met daily and received<br/>
	presentations from Korean experts and responders and discussed critical questions, findings and<br/>
	issues. These presentations and discussions were open to all members of the mission team. Topics<br/>
	included viral characteristics based on international laboratory testing results, clinical management,<br/>
	5<br/>
	epidemiological trends, outbreak investigations, public concerns and risk communications strategies,<br/>
	disease prevention and control measures including contact tracing, monitoring and travel restrictions,<br/>
	information gaps requiring further study, and data management. Topics were discussed in plenary and<br/>
	then often in more detail in smaller subgroups of experts. Some mission members visited Samsung<br/>
	Medical Center and the Emergency Operating Center at the Ministry of Health and Welfare and<br/>
	attended a meeting convened by the Acting Prime Minister. The mission co-leads also met with Her<br/>
	Excellency President Park.<br/>
	During the last two days of the mission, a briefing was given to the Minister of Health and Welfare<br/>
	and a press conference was held. The agenda of the joint mission is included as Annex 4.<br/>
	4. FINDINGS<br/>
	4.1 Epidemiological findings<br/>
	At the time of the mission, active investigation of cases and their source of infection and contact<br/>
	tracing were ongoing. All known cases were either: health-care workers caring for confirmed cases;<br/>
	patients being cared for at the same health-care facilities as confirmed patients; or family members,<br/>
	friends or others who had visited a confirmed patient or who had visited the same room or facility<br/>
	housing a confirmed case.<br/>
	Within the overall outbreak, three large clustering events were identified. These involved nosocomial<br/>
	transmission in Hospital B (Pyungtaek St Mary’s Hospital) and Hospital D (Samsung Medical<br/>
	Center), and one situation where exposure to a case (case #16) resulted in two smaller clusters in<br/>
	hospitals E and F (KonYang University Hospital and Dae Cheong Hospital). Knowledge of the factors<br/>
	associated with these outbreaks is increasing as more investigations are carried out but many details<br/>
	about transmission are not well understood and will require further investigation.<br/>
	Among the people who were infected in the Republic of Korea one had travelled to China, first by<br/>
	plane to Hong Kong SAR (China), and then by bus to Guangdong. That person was symptomatic<br/>
	while travelling. On the basis of information provided by the Republic of Korea under IHR 2005,<br/>
	Chinese authorities were able to rapidly locate, provide care for and isolate this person. The Chinese<br/>
	authorities were also able to identify contacts in China. The contacts have been placed in quarantine<br/>
	and are being followed and tested for MERS. No additional cases have been identified among<br/>
	contacts in Hong Kong SAR (China) (n=28) or in China (n=75). This is the first MERS case reported<br/>
	in China.<br/>

	Efforts to control the outbreak and prevent further spread are being intensified; a timeline of events is<br/>
	shown in Figure 2.<br/>

	4.2 Clinical features of cases<br/>
	Among laboratory-confirmed cases in the Republic of Korea, the clinical spectrum of illness has<br/>
	ranged from mild illness to severe disease and death. Among the first 87 cases, the most common<br/>
	7<br/>
	symptoms were fever (97%), cough (43%), myalgia (30%), and sputum production (24%). Dyspnoea,<br/>
	nausea/vomiting, and diarrhoea were reported less often, at 5.7%, 5.7%, and 9.2%, respectively.<br/>
	The median age was 55 years (range 16–83); 49 are male (56.3%); and 45 (51.7%) had underlying<br/>
	diseases. The mean incubation period has been estimated at 6.5 (SD 3.2) days. The case-fatality rate at<br/>
	the time of presentation was 7.9% (10 deaths among 126 confirmed cases); all fatal cases thus far had<br/>
	comorbid illness. As of 11 June, five cases were intubated.<br/>
	An early investigation of the first 58 cases showed that chest radiographs were normal on presentation<br/>
	in 27 (46.5%), or showed bilateral infiltrates or unilateral infiltrates in 16 (27.5%) and13 (22.4%)<br/>
	cases, respectively. Hypoalbuminemia (&lt; 3.5 g/dL), leukopaenia, thrombocytopaenia, and elevated<br/>
	liver enzymes (AST/ALT) were found in less than 50% of cases.<br/>
	4.3 Case/contact identification and management<br/>
	Both active and passive methods are being used to find cases of MERS infection and contacts.<br/>
	Methods to find contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases included interviews of cases and their family<br/>
	members, review of closed-circuit television (CCTV) video surveillance in health-care facilities and<br/>
	use of global positioning system (GPS) tracking of mobile phones to identify the location of contacts.<br/>
	Such activities are not done routinely but have been used because of the urgent need to stop the<br/>
	outbreak.1<br/>
	All contacts are recorded in a database maintained by the MERS Task Force in the Ministry of Health<br/>
	and Welfare. Once a contact is identified, a staff member (usually an epidemic intelligence service<br/>
	(EIS) officer) visits and interviews the contact and on that basis, classifies the contact as either<br/>
	“casual” (anyone who has visited a health-care facility where a confirmed case was treated or a person<br/>
	who was in the same household or hospital) or as “close” (a person who was in close proximity to<br/>
	confirmed case but was not wearing personal protective equipment, a person who was within a<br/>
	two-metre distance, a person who had direct contact with respiratory secretions, or passengers, or<br/>
	cabin crew sitting around a confirmed or suspected case).<br/>
	During the potential incubation period of 14 days, each contact is called twice daily by government<br/>
	officials to check for the development of symptoms. Initially, monitoring focused upon the<br/>
	development of fever but from approximately 9–10 June, fever and respiratory symptoms have been<br/>
	monitored. As of 2 June, quarantine at home for close contacts has been mandatory for 14 days after<br/>
	exposure to a confirmed case. If a close contact does not follow quarantine conditions, the contact is<br/>
	physically brought back to his or her home by government officials wearing protective gear. For<br/>
	casual contacts, quarantine at home is recommended for 14 days after exposure to a confirmed MERS<br/>
	case. During quarantine, any contact who develops symptoms (respiratory or fever) is transported by<br/>
	ambulance to one of 19 referral health-care facilities designated for MERS patients and placed in<br/>
	isolation and a specimen (usually sputum) is collected for laboratory testing.<br/>
	After 14 days from the time of exposure to a case, a symptomatic contact is released from isolation if<br/>
	polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results are negative on two different specimens collected 48<br/>
	hours apart and if the contact has no symptoms. A symptomatic contact who tests positive for MERS<br/>
	by PCR is considered a laboratory-confirmed case and is provided treatment in isolation. Confirmed<br/>
	1 These measures were taken in accordance with the Personal Information Protection Act and the Infectious Disease Control<br/>
	and Prevention Act in the Republic of Korea.<br/>
	8<br/>
	cases are released after two samples, collected 24 hours apart, have tested negative by PCR and if the<br/>
	case has no symptoms for more than 48 hours.<br/>
	In the initial stages of the outbreak, laboratory testing and confirmation were centralized at the Korean<br/>
	National Institutes of Health (KNIH). However, testing is now conducted by many more laboratories.<br/>
	The KNIH laboratory was using standard WHO-recommended molecular diagnostic methods for<br/>
	testing and confirmation and had previously taken part in a WHO external quality control programme<br/>
	with excellent results.<br/>
	4.3.1 Active case finding<br/>
	In addition to reporting of cases by health facilities, the Government has implemented two additional<br/>
	surveillance programmes to identify cases.<br/>
	On 5 June 2015, KCDC began testing patients with severe pneumonia in four geographic areas<br/>
	(Seoul Metropolitan City, Gyeonggi province, Chungnam province, and Daejeon Metropolitan City)<br/>
	for MERS. During 5–10 June, 237 severe pneumonia patients were identified, from which 139 sputum<br/>
	specimens were collected and tested for MERS. One sample tested positive (case #121). This sample<br/>
	came from a patient who had already been identified as a contact and who, after developing<br/>
	symptoms, had already been placed in isolation.<br/>
	On 9 June, a cross-sectional survey was started to test all people who were hospitalized with<br/>
	pneumonia, who were 15 years or older and who had an epidemiological link to a confirmed case or<br/>
	to a health-care facility where any MERS patient was treated or reported for MERS. This survey will<br/>
	cover hospitals across the Republic of Korea and was to run for one week. As of 12 June, 1064<br/>
	hospitals had started and thus far, 11 hospitals have identified 13 pneumonia cases that meet the<br/>
	criteria. Among these 13, five were already isolated and on the contact list, while eight were not.<br/>
	None of the 13 tested positive for MERS.<br/>
	4.3.2 Passive case finding<br/>
	The Government has made public announcements (at press conferences, through the MERS hotline,<br/>
	and online) requesting that people, who suspect they have symptoms compatible with MERS or who<br/>
	have visited a health-care facility where MERS patients were treated, go to one of 256 designated<br/>
	hospitals for evaluation.<br/>
	4.4 Outbreak response operations<br/>
	Before the current outbreak, an overarching national plan for the prevention and control of emerging<br/>
	infectious diseases, including a specific plan for response to MERS, was in place.<br/>
	The national plan, which includes four phases of response, was adapted for the current outbreak and<br/>
	covered the establishment of a situation monitoring system (24 hours a day/7 days a week), expanded<br/>
	laboratory testing capacities, and stockpiling of personal protective equipment.<br/>
	The MERS Response Center coordinates the overall health response, especially planning, field<br/>
	response, resource management and communication.<br/>
	9<br/>
	In early June, response measures were significantly intensified (Annex 2). These measures included<br/>
	new policies and emergency measures, implementation of an information system to manage all cases<br/>
	and contacts, a contact location tracking system, a government subsidy for close contacts under<br/>
	quarantine, hospital infection prevention and control, patient management and risk communication<br/>
	activities.<br/>
	During the mission, operational challenges included maintaining adequate staffing for the outbreak<br/>
	response for a prolonged period; vertical coordination among government, Ministry of Health and<br/>
	Welfare, KCDC, and Field Operations; managing a large and growing number of contacts;<br/>
	coordinating a growing amounts of data from different sources; translating knowledge into clear and<br/>
	balanced risk communication messages; and handling sensitive issues such as risk communications,<br/>
	quarantine policy and school closures.<br/>
	4.5 International collaboration<br/>
	The Republic of Korea promptly communicated information on the outbreak to WHO via the IHR<br/>
	(2005) mechanism. The Republic of Korea was also communicating with other governments via the<br/>
	IHR (2005), including information about foreign nationals on the contact list and contacts travelling to<br/>
	other countries before control efforts were intensified.<br/>
	In addition to sharing information via IHR (2005), the Korean health authorities endeavoured to<br/>
	ensure monitoring of contacts abroad. In particular, contacts of Korean nationality traveling abroad<br/>
	were actively located through Korean embassies, and then were put under quarantine with guidelines<br/>
	to follow until release in close cooperation with health authorities abroad. Recognizing the importance<br/>
	of sharing MERS-related information with the international community as well as foreigners residing<br/>
	in the country, the Republic of Korea provided English-translated press releases, MERS statistics and<br/>
	the list of hospitals with MERS exposures through the nation’s MERS portal website<br/>
	(<a href="../../../www.mers.go.kr/9dd82ef88bb3f52fc31b2b912bb53fb6">www.mers.go.kr</a>) as well as the Ministry of Health and Welfare website. The Republic of Korea also<br/>
	established the MERS hotline with services in multiple languages including English, Chinese and<br/>
	Japanese.<br/>
	Virus genetic sequences from one patient in the Republic of Korea have been shared with WHO<br/>
	experts by KNIH. Virus genetic sequence from the patient hospitalized in China was publicly shared<br/>
	via the United States National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank. This virus<br/>
	genetic information was discussed at a WHO teleconference on 7 June 2015 (see report at:<br/>
<a href="../../../www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/risk-assessment-9june2015/en/af1038dc400fc2108d13ff310194ec75">http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/risk-assessment-9june2015/en/</a>) and was<br/>
	pivotal in reaching international consensus that genetic mutations did not appear to be a significant<br/>
	concern for this outbreak. Clinical specimens have been shared with the United States Centers for<br/>
	Disease Control and Prevention.<br/>
	5. ASSESSMENT<br/>
	5.1 Factors contributing to the initial spread of MERS<br/>
	This outbreak in the Republic of Korea started with the introduction of a single case of MERS into the<br/>
	country in a traveller who recently returned from visiting Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates,<br/>
	and Bahrain (18 April–4 May). The spread of infection has been amplified by uncontrolled exposures<br/>
	in health facilities, resulting in a significant number of secondary cases among contacts, primarily in<br/>
	10<br/>
	hospitals. As of 12 June, 126 laboratory-confirmed cases had been identified (including the case who<br/>
	travelled to China).<br/>
	One difficulty in monitoring the progress of the outbreak, and a source of confusion for the public and<br/>
	others, has been the reporting of cases. The daily counts of cases provided by the Republic of Korea<br/>
	have included newly identified cases whose infection occurred in the past (for example, older cases<br/>
	associated with earlier hospital clusters) and new cases, reflecting recent infection.<br/>
	This issue is important because, as shown in the epidemic curve, it appears as if the trend in new<br/>
	incident cases is declining; but it is too early to tell whether the trend is firm or whether it represents a<br/>
	reporting lag. This will require another few weeks for a robust assessment but suggests that recent<br/>
	implementation of much stronger disease control measures, such as contact tracing and monitoring<br/>
	and quarantine measures, is working.<br/>
	Several factors appear to have contributed to the initial spread of this virus:<br/>
	• Since MERS is a new infection in the Republic of Korea, physicians and public health<br/>
	authorities did not expect it. In some instances, a travel history was not collected from cases,<br/>
	contributing to a time lag in diagnosis and isolation of cases.<br/>
	• In some hospitals, infection prevention and control measures were not optimal, related in part<br/>
	to crowded emergency rooms and hospitalization of infectious patients and other patients<br/>
	together in multi-bed rooms for extended periods. Before the index case was diagnosed, he<br/>
	had contact with many people leading to spread of infection in three health-care facilities.<br/>
	After diagnosis, he was transferred to the National Medical Center, which was designated by<br/>
	the Government for MERS treatment. He was placed in a negative pressure isolation room.<br/>
	The index case was admitted to Hospital B when he did not yet have a diagnosis. This<br/>
	resulted in 38 new MERS cases. Some of these people were then treated in other health-care<br/>
	facilities before their MERS infection was diagnosed, thus spreading the virus to others.<br/>
	• Certain social patterns and customs contributed to the spread of infection among hospitals.<br/>
	For example, the practice of “doctor shopping”, in which patients move from one health-care<br/>
	facility to another seeking care, allowed infected patients to come in contact with more people<br/>
	than if they had stayed with one facility. The custom of many friends and family members<br/>
	accompanying or visiting patients in emergency departments or in hospital also exposed more<br/>
	contacts to infection.<br/>
	5.2 Initial observations<br/>
	Overall, the pattern of nosocomial infections in the Republic of Korea is similar to nosocomial<br/>
	outbreaks observed in the Middle East (e.g. Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (Annex 3)).<br/>
	Despite the critical role of suboptimal infection prevention and control measures, especially in<br/>
	crowded situations, there are still unanswered questions about the role of other factors and conditions<br/>
	that may make it easier for this virus to spread from person to person. For example, questions remain<br/>
	about changes in viral sequences and structure affecting transmission properties, environmental<br/>
	contamination, suboptimal ventilation or airborne virus transmission and the potential role of<br/>
	asymptomatic/mild cases, particularly in health-care workers, in transmission.<br/>
	11<br/>
	Although definitive conclusions are not yet possible, some initial observations can be made:<br/>
	• So far, genetic sequences of two viruses from this outbreak in the Republic of Korea (one<br/>
	virus from the Republic of Korea and one virus from the Korean national who travelled to<br/>
	China) appear genetically similar to viruses found in the Middle East. At present, there is no<br/>
	evidence to suggest that the MERS viruses in the Republic of Korea are significantly different<br/>
	genetically from recent viruses in the Middle East.<br/>
	• This mission team was not able to determine whether environmental contamination or<br/>
	airborne transmission had any role in the spread of this virus. These are complex issues that<br/>
	will require further investigation, including experimental studies. Ongoing consideration of<br/>
	such possibilities is important because the factors affecting transmission remain poorly<br/>
	understood. Nonetheless, this outbreak appears similar to hospital-associated outbreaks that<br/>
	have occurred in the Middle East and does not appear to have new epidemiological features<br/>
	that would suggest a shift in how the virus is transmitted.<br/>
	• There is no evidence of ongoing community transmission of MERS. All cases, including<br/>
	those among family members, can be linked to probable exposure in a hospital. The issue of<br/>
	community transmission is important to clarify. Because this virus clearly can spread from<br/>
	person to person, it is possible and even likely that examples of person-to-person transmission<br/>
	outside health-care settings might be found. The identification of such sporadic cases would<br/>
	be neither surprising nor particularly important unless it were indicative of ongoing<br/>
	transmission in the community. Sporadic transmission outside health settings, for example,<br/>
	within families, has occurred in other MERS outbreaks in the Middle East without evolving<br/>
	into sustained community spread.<br/>
	• Transmission of virus in Hospital B (Pyungtaek St Mary’s Hospital) and in Hospital D<br/>
	(Samsung Medical Center) resulted in large clusters. The size of these clusters is of concern,<br/>
	but not unprecedented. In 2014, Jeddah and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, experienced large<br/>
	nosocomial outbreaks ranging from 2 to 180 cases per hospital. In the Republic of Korea, the<br/>
	clusters associated with Pyungtaek St Mary’s Hospital (38 cases including one case exported<br/>
	to China) and Samsung Medical Center (approximately 70 cases at the time of the mission)<br/>
	appear to have resulted from many individuals with prolonged exposure to infectious patients<br/>
	in crowded areas and before MERS was suspected. Investigation of all factors related to<br/>
	transmission in such clusters is critical as such studies may improve the understanding of how<br/>
	this virus is spread.<br/>
	5.3 Risk of spread to other countries<br/>
	While the spread of MERS from the Republic of Korea to other countries remains possible, extensive<br/>
	efforts using a variety of approaches are being made to identify both symptomatic and asymptomatic<br/>
	individuals who are presumably at elevated risk of incubating MERS infection. Such efforts,<br/>
	including multiple approaches to detect cases and identify contacts, mandatory quarantine of close<br/>
	contacts, and restriction of international travel of all cases and contacts, are impressive and appear to<br/>
	be having an effect since incident cases are declining. The combination of these efforts, which are<br/>
	aimed at identifying symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, is likely to be more effective than<br/>
	screening measures at borders.<br/>
	12<br/>
	6. RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE<br/>
	REPUBLIC OF KOREA<br/>
	The following high-level recommendations were shared and discussed with the Minister for Health<br/>
	and Welfare and his staff on 13 June:<br/>
	1) Infection prevention and control measures may be immediately strengthened in all health-care<br/>
	facilities in the Republic of Korea.<br/>
	2) All patients presenting with fever or respiratory symptoms may be asked about: contact with a<br/>
	MERS patient; visits to a health-care facility where a MERS patient has been treated; and<br/>
	history of travel to the Middle East 14 days before symptom onset. Any patient with positive<br/>
	responses should be promptly reported to public health authorities and managed as a<br/>
	suspected case while the diagnosis is being confirmed.<br/>
	3) Close contacts of MERS cases should not travel during the period when they are being<br/>
	monitored for the development of symptoms.<br/>
	4) Strong consideration may be given to reopening schools, as schools have not been linked to<br/>
	transmission of MERS in the Republic of Korea or elsewhere.<br/>
	5) Continued implementation of basic public health measures by all health authorities will<br/>
	contribute to stopping further cases. These measures include:<br/>
	a. early and complete identification and investigation of all contacts;<br/>
	b. robust quarantine/isolation and monitoring of all contacts and suspected cases;<br/>
	c. full implementation of infection prevention and control measures; and<br/>
	d. prevention of travel, especially internationally, of infected people and contacts.<br/>
	6) Local governments must be fully engaged and mobilized in this national emergency.<br/>
	7) In parallel with disease prevention and control measures, it is important to strengthen<br/>
	domestic and international confidence. This includes improving risk communications. The<br/>
	Ministry of Health and Welfare may provide regular updates (in Korean and English) on the<br/>
	epidemiological situation, investigations and disease control measures.<br/>
	8) Additional staff (for surge capacity) are urgently required for the response and to provide<br/>
	relief for staff working on the outbreak.<br/>
	9) Selected hospitals may be designated for safe triage and assessment of suspected MERS cases.<br/>
	This will require trained personnel, facility management and communication with the public.<br/>
	10) Comprehensive research studies designed to close critical gaps in knowledge, including seroepidemiological<br/>
	studies, may be completed and the results widely communicated as quickly<br/>
	as possible.<br/>
	11) The Republic of Korea may ensure that it is able to optimally respond to future outbreaks.<br/>
	This includes strengthening medical facilities to deal with serious infectious diseases<br/>
	(including increased numbers of negative-pressure isolation rooms), considering how to<br/>
	reduce the practice of “doctor shopping”, training more infection prevention and control<br/>
	specialists, infectious disease experts, laboratory scientists, epidemiologists, and risk<br/>
	communication experts, and investing in strengthening public health capacities and leadership,<br/>
	including at the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).<br/>
	In addition to these high-level recommendations, the joint mission team made technical<br/>
	recommendations, which can be applicable in the Republic of Korea and other countries when<br/>
	combating a MERS outbreak. These are available in Annex 5.<br/>

	ANNEX 2. LIST OF KEY ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA<br/>
	TO ADDRESS MERS<br/>
	Date Actions<br/>
	20 May<br/>
	First imported case of MERS confirmed.<br/>
	MERS alert level was elevated from ATTENTION (BLUE) to CAUTION (YELLOW).<br/>
	• MERS Response Unit (led by Chief of Infection Control Centre, KCDC) was<br/>
	expanded to National MERS Response Centre (led by Assistant Minister and<br/>
	Director of KCDC)<br/>
	• Strengthened border quarantine measures against returning travellers from Middle<br/>
	East from self-declaration to thermal screening system<br/>
	21 May KCDC convened an expert advisory committee on MERS following the identification of<br/>
	two additional infected cases – (1) spouse of index case (case #2), and (2) a patient (case<br/>
	#3) who admitted at same hospital room when the index case was admitted at hospital B<br/>
	from 15 to 17 May 2015. The committee advised while keeping the alert level at<br/>
	YELLOW to intensify public health measures including isolation of 64 close contacts<br/>
	(family members and healthcare workers) and active monitoring for 14 days after last<br/>
	contact<br/>
	26 May KCDC revised the definition of suspected cases by lowering temperate threshold from 38<br/>
	degree Celsius to 37.5 degree Celsius following the identification of additional infected<br/>
	case – daughter of case #3 (case #4) and two suspected cases among healthcare worker<br/>
	close contacts.<br/>
	29 May MOHW urgently convened two meetings – (1) the Expert Committee on Infectious<br/>
	Disease Crisis Management and (2) a meeting with concerned ministries and provincial<br/>
	government. These meeting occurred after the travel incident of a suspected case to<br/>
	China. While keeping the alert level at YELLOW, the response system was further<br/>
	strengthened as follows:<br/>
	• To establish the MERS response task force in MOHW under the leadership of<br/>
	Vice-Minister<br/>
	• To conduct contact identification exercise again<br/>
	• To examine the readiness of designated isolation facilities nationwide<br/>
	• To strengthen the monitoring of returning travellers from Middle East<br/>

	ANNEX 3. GLOBAL SITUATION AND CONTEXT<br/>
	Global situation<br/>
	As of 12 June 2015, 1285 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with Middle East respiratory<br/>
	syndrome coronavirus (MERS) had been reported to WHO since 2012, including at least 442 deaths.<br/>
	Overall, 65% of cases (n=838) are male and the median age is 50 years (range 9 months to 99 years).<br/>
	To date, 25 countries have reported cases, including countries in the Middle East: Egypt, Iran, Jordan,<br/>
	Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen; in Africa: Algeria,<br/>
	and Tunisia; in Europe: Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey and the<br/>
	United Kingdom; in Asia: China, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines; and in North<br/>
	America: the United States of America (USA). The majority of cases (more than 85%) have been<br/>
	reported from Saudi Arabia. Since May 2015 two new countries have been affected (China and the<br/>
	Republic of Korea).<br/>
	Situation in Saudi Arabia<br/>
	The first report of MERS described a patient who died from a severe respiratory illness in a hospital<br/>
	in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in June 2012.<br/>
	MERS cases have continued to be reported in countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula, with more<br/>
	than 85% of cases reported from Saudi Arabia. A camel (Camelus dromedarius) reservoir is suspected<br/>
	based on case investigations, serologic studies, and the isolation of live infectious MERS from<br/>
	camels. Limited human-to-human transmission has been documented in households and in health-care<br/>
	facilities, but no sustained community transmission has been documented. Although shedding of<br/>
	MERS RNA from the upper respiratory tract of cases with mild symptoms (typically health-care<br/>
	workers) is well documented, the potential role in transmission of mildly ill cases is not well defined.<br/>
	Outbreaks of MERS continue to be reported in the Arabian Peninsula, highlighting the ongoing risk of<br/>
	transmission of this emerging respiratory virus. Although the risk factors for transmission have not<br/>
	been thoroughly described, limited human-to-human transmission has been documented through<br/>
	contact investigations in households and in health-care facilities. In Jeddah in 2014, secondary<br/>
	transmission (often without clearly defined links) accounted for 97% of assessed cases, including in<br/>
	health-care workers, patients and visitors to health-care facilities.<br/>
	Multi-facility outbreaks in Al-Hassa and Taif in 2013 and 2014 and, more recently, in Hofuf, Eastern<br/>
	Province, in 2015, highlight the explosive nature and high morbidity and mortality of MERS in<br/>
	health-care settings.<br/>
	Factors that led to outbreaks in health-care settings in Saudi Arabia included crowding in emergency<br/>
	rooms, inadequate triage and delayed recognition. The Saudi Ministry of Health established a<br/>
	command centre to respond to MERS infection. It oversees infection control, clinical operation, risk<br/>
	communication, laboratory capacity, and interministerial and public health response to MERS. In<br/>
	Saudi Arabia, each health-care facility had to establish a triage system in the emergency room for<br/>
	patients with suspected respiratory infections. The Ministry of Health carried out extensive training<br/>
	throughout the country of health-care personnel on early recognition of suspected MERS patients and<br/>
	the proper use of personal protective equipment. A large number of negative-pressure rooms were<br/>
	added to existing facilities. Although every health-care facility must be ready to manage suspected<br/>
	cases of MERS, certain hospitals were prepared and designated to manage confirmed cases. Experts<br/>
	in infection control were hired, and additional resources are being acquired.<br/>
	Fortunately, no MERS cases were associated with the 2013 and 2014 Hajj pilgrimages.<br/>

	ANNEX 5. TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS<br/>
	The following technical recommendations are made to the Republic of Korea and for the<br/>
	consideration of other governments in managing MERS outbreaks.<br/>
	A1. Response strategy and measures<br/>
	The main goals of the response should be to stop the outbreak in the country, prevent spread<br/>
	internationally and decrease public anxiety. All actions should be guided by ongoing risk assessments.<br/>
	1) Mobilize and prioritize resources needed to ensure implementation of key control measures,<br/>
	including hospital infection prevention and control, a system for early detection of suspected<br/>
	cases and contact management, patient management and risk communications.<br/>
	2) Expand epidemiological analytic capability and data visualization: create clear daily situation<br/>
	reports of key indicators for decision-makers.<br/>
	3) Capitalize on the opportunity the outbreak creates to generate important knowledge about MERS<br/>
	epidemics by creating a dedicated scientific studies team within the response structure.<br/>
	4) Consider a back-up team comprising people removed from operational responsibilities whose<br/>
	purpose is to consider broad issues, detect unusual patterns, monitor and evaluate response<br/>
	metrics for course correction, and anticipate the need for strategic changes.<br/>
	5) Enhance risk communication skills.<br/>
	6) Continue timely communication and sharing of information with the international community,<br/>
	including control measures.<br/>
	7) Revise the national response plan to include new scenarios for nosocomial and health-care facility<br/>
	outbreaks.<br/>
	8) Consider creating an interim action evaluation and after-action report.<br/>
	9) Prepare for future outbreak responses through increased investment in public health surveillance<br/>
	and response systems, especially a field epidemiology training programme, as required under IHR<br/>
	(2005).<br/>
	A2. Surveillance<br/>
	Surveillance should be enhanced to detect new cases who are linked to the hospital outbreaks and,<br/>
	especially, to identify cases that may not be linked to the current chain of transmission. The<br/>
	geographical area targeted will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis and is defined by the<br/>
	suspected exposures of the case under investigation. The duration of enhanced surveillance will<br/>
	depend on the findings of the case investigations and whether there is evidence to indicate that<br/>
	community transmission may be occurring in the area. A minimum of one month of enhanced<br/>
	surveillance is a reasonable starting point.<br/>
	1) Establish sentinel-based surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), irrespective<br/>
	of a history of contact, in provinces where there are laboratory-confirmed cases.2<br/>
	2) It is strongly recommended that the surveillance for pneumonia patients (the severe pneumonia<br/>
	surveillance in four geographic regions and the cross-sectional survey for clinical pneumonia in<br/>
	hospitalized patients described above) include MERS testing for all hospitalized pneumonia cases,<br/>
	regardless of an epidemiologic link to a confirmed case or hospital where cases have been treated.<br/>
	3) All returning travellers from the Middle East, who have had direct or indirect contact with<br/>
	dromedary camels (e.g. visiting a market or racetrack) or have visited a health-care facility and<br/>
	2 WHO. Global Epidemiological Surveillance Standards for Influenza, January 2014<br/>
<a href="../../../www.who.int/influenza/resources/documents/influenza_surveillance_manual/en/55110b82c52fbcfc95ec9c5ac6d62bde">http://www.who.int/influenza/resources/documents/influenza_surveillance_manual/en/</a><br/>
	19<br/>
	who develop respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms within 14 days of return should<br/>
	immediately notify their health-care provider.<br/>
	4) To evaluate the extent of infection among close contacts, sero-epidemiology studies may be<br/>
	implemented in cohorts of close contacts (health-care workers, patients) to define risk factors for<br/>
	infection. This may be particularly relevant for the three major case clusters observed so far.<br/>
	WHO has developed sero-epidemiologic investigation protocols for close contacts3, and<br/>
	separately for health-care workers, which could be used in the outbreak4.<br/>
	5) As detailed information is being collected from confirmed cases and their contacts, infection rates<br/>
	by exposure type can be stratified (i.e. higher risk activities vs. lower risk activities).<br/>
	A3. Contact tracing<br/>
	Contact tracing is a critical part of disease control. The intensified activities of the Government to<br/>
	identify all contacts, rapid and enforced home quarantine among close contacts, follow up for 14 days<br/>
	after the date of exposure, and immediate isolation and testing of contacts with symptoms will have a<br/>
	positive impact on the outbreak. Contact management requires mutual support between the<br/>
	government and the public, especially to ensure that home quarantine does not become an amplifier of<br/>
	infection. Early isolation of suspected MERS cases in emergency departments and hospitals will<br/>
	minimize the likelihood of exposure to other people.<br/>
	1) The number of hospitals individuals should visit if they suspect they have MERS should be<br/>
	reduced. Messages to the public can assist that worried individuals are directed to a smaller<br/>
	number of hospitals, which are prepared to quickly isolate suspect cases while testing is underway.<br/>
	2) The restriction of movement of contacts and the monitoring of contacts for 14 days since their last<br/>
	exposure are essential.<br/>
	3) Close contacts of MERS cases should not travel, especially internationally, when they are being<br/>
	monitored for the development of symptoms.<br/>
	4) At this time, the use of two categories of contacts (close and casual) seems appropriate and<br/>
	cautious. As the epidemic progresses and our understanding improves of increases in infection<br/>
	rates among contacts, the Government may want to consider a third category to try to capture<br/>
	high-, medium-, and low-risk contacts.<br/>
	A4. Laboratory<br/>
	1) As PCR testing for MERS is now decentralized to provincial, private and hospital laboratories,<br/>
	the testing algorithms and methods may be harmonized. A system for quality assurance and<br/>
	quality control should be implemented to ensure sensitivity and specificity of the laboratory<br/>
	diagnostic system. Aliquots of positive specimens should be submitted to the national laboratory<br/>
	for further investigations (e.g. genetic analysis) where appropriate.<br/>
	2) Explore ways to decrease turnaround times for laboratory diagnostic testing and reporting, to<br/>
	minimize delays in specimen transport and the reporting of results back to clinicians.<br/>
	3) Currently, the primary specimen being used for laboratory diagnosis is sputum. Lower respiratory<br/>
	specimens (e.g. sputum, endotracheal aspirate) can give a higher diagnostic yield than upper<br/>
	respiratory specimens (e.g. nasopharyngeal swab, broncho-alveolar lavage), when considered<br/>
	overall. However, the mucus content of sputa can sometimes pose a challenge for efficient nucleic<br/>
	acid extraction and may contain PCR inhibitors, sometimes leading to false-negative results. Thus,<br/>
	it is recommended that, wherever possible, nasopharyngeal swabs be used in parallel with sputum,<br/>

	20<br/>
	especially in highly suspected cases and when retesting is done for patients who yield equivocal<br/>
	results on initial testing. Also, repeat testing is advisable before a diagnosis of MERS in highly<br/>
	suspected patients is ruled out.<br/>
	4) Serial sampling for viral load assays should be attempted on selected patients to assess periods of<br/>
	peak infectivity and the impact of commencement of antiviral therapy.<br/>
	5) PCR testing of non-respiratory specimens (faeces, plasma, urine) from representative patients<br/>
	should be carried out to define dissemination of the virus beyond the respiratory tract. Virus<br/>
	isolation should be attempted on any PCR-positive specimens. This would help to assess potential<br/>
	nosocomial risks from body fluids other than respiratory specimens.<br/>
	6) Viral genetic sequencing should be carried out from the direct clinical specimen rather than viral<br/>
	isolates wherever possible from representatives of time and place, for enhancing epidemiological<br/>
	understanding and for genetic characterization to provide monitoring for potential biological<br/>
	changes in circulating viruses.<br/>
	7) Viral isolates should be obtained from representative patient samples for biological<br/>
	characterization for comparison with reference strains. Such biological characterization may<br/>
	involve, but not be limited to, viral replication kinetics in primary human respiratory epithelial<br/>
	cells, differentiated human respiratory epithelial cultures, or in vivo cultures of the human<br/>
	respiratory tract.<br/>
	8) Antibody titres on serial serum samples from selected patients should be carried out to define the<br/>
	antibody kinetics of MERS infections.<br/>
	9) Testing of environmental samples for virus RNA should be considered to assess potential<br/>
	transmission routes. These may include swabs of surfaces in patient-care settings and air sampling.<br/>
	Wherever relevant, virus culture should be attempted from virus RNA-positive samples to<br/>
	differentiate live virus from inactive viral RNA.<br/>
	10) Close and regular networking between laboratory and epidemiology colleagues may be<br/>
	encouraged to facilitate efficient collaboration.<br/>
	11) Obtaining host innate immune response data (e.g. plasma cytokine, chemokine levels) over the<br/>
	course of the disease may help to better understand pathogenesis.<br/>
	12) Handling unexpected epidemics of respiratory viruses requires laboratories to maintain surge<br/>
	capacity. Appropriate resource allocations may be made for staff, equipment, and consumables so<br/>
	that capacity is built and maintained in “peace time”, as it is impossible to ramp up such capacity<br/>
	in times of crisis.<br/>
	13) Participation in the WHO laboratory network is encouraged to share information and novel<br/>
	findings that are relevant to public health and clinical care. These might include sharing of viral<br/>
	genetic sequences, novel virological findings, virological specimens or virus isolates. In particular,<br/>
	collecting sera from confirmed infected patients to contribute to the WHO serum biobank would<br/>
	allow different serological tests to be evaluated and validated in a collaborative manner.<br/>
	A5. Clinical management<br/>
	Good clinical management can result in decreased morbidity and mortality.<br/>
	1) Cases of unexplained pneumonia should be managed with a high suspicion for MERS. Early<br/>
	implementation of infection control measures and MERS testing are essential to prevent outbreaks.<br/>
	2) Although there is no specific treatment for MERS, experimental protocols may be used in a<br/>
	standardized and closely monitored way.<br/>
	3) Understanding the kinetics of MERS will guide initiation of anti-viral agents. Serial sampling of<br/>
	upper and lower respiratory tract specimens (where appropriate) should be done.<br/>
	4) Based on experience with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and pandemic influenza,<br/>
	convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from MERS is likely to be an effective<br/>
	treatment option.<br/>
	21<br/>
	A6. Infection prevention and control<br/>
	Early recognition of transmissible infections is the cornerstone of the prevention of healthcareassociated<br/>
	outbreaks. Emergency departments and respiratory clinics need to effectively triage<br/>
	patients with potential respiratory infections, especially those with epidemiological links (travel<br/>
	history, contact with MERS cases). Infection prevention and control measures may immediately be<br/>
	strengthened in all facilities across the country.<br/>
	1) The 19 currently designated referral hospitals for MERS patients may be assessed for infection<br/>
	prevention and control practices, and the availability of personal protective equipment and singlebed<br/>
	rooms.<br/>
	2) Patients with suspected or confirmed MERS may require transfer to other facilities. Therefore, a<br/>
	clear protocol to address infection control and risk communication issues is needed.<br/>
	3) Effective communication between health-care facilities regarding the movement of patients with<br/>
	potentially infectious diseases may prevent further spread of MERS. The public health authority<br/>
	may trace individuals on the contact list and alert health-care facilities caring for these individuals.<br/>
	Health-care facilities must inform public health authorities when these patients are being<br/>
	transferred or discharged.<br/>
	4) Adequate human resources are needed to run effective infection control activities. Significant<br/>
	shortages of infection control professionals were noted in one hospital and are likely to be an<br/>
	issue in others.<br/>
	5) Transmission of MERS takes place mainly through droplet and contact routes. Therefore,<br/>
	adequate space between patients (at least one meter) in waiting rooms and clinical areas,<br/>
	especially in emergency rooms and intensive care units, is essential.<br/>
	6) MERS may be aerosolized during certain respiratory procedures. Because jet nebulizers are used<br/>
	in some countries for patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and some of<br/>
	these patients may also be infected with MERS, procedures such as nebulization and intubation<br/>
	should be performed in negative-pressure rooms as part of infection prevention and control<br/>
	measures. Where negative-pressure isolation rooms are not available, consider alternative<br/>
	methods to improve ventilation, such as installation of window exhaust fans or portable HEPA<br/>
	filters. The role of jet nebulizers and other respiratory procedures that may generate aerosols (e.g.<br/>
	intubation, sputum suction, bronchoscopy, non-invasive ventilation, tracheostomy) in enhancing<br/>
	disease transmission should be examined in major hospital outbreaks of MERS.<br/>
	7) Knowledge and practice of proper infection control practices requires regular training, auditing<br/>
	and accountability. Training on respiratory protection should be offered now to all health-care<br/>
	workers.<br/>
	8) To ensure maximum protection of health-care workers from aerosolized MERS, high-efficiency<br/>
	respirator fit testing should be performed, especially for those working in critical areas<br/>
	(emergency rooms, intensive care units, respiratory clinics).<br/>
	9) Environmental factors may play a role in transmitting MERS. As part of outbreak investigation,<br/>
	environmental sampling (by real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing and<br/>
	viral cultures) should be performed and additional environmental decontamination techniques<br/>
	considered for high-risk areas.<br/>
	10) For health-care workers exposed to MERS:<br/>
	a. Examine in depth the events that led to the secondary transmission (time, place and<br/>
	person).<br/>
	b. Establish a screening clinic where temperature and symptoms are evaluated daily during<br/>
	the incubation period.<br/>
	c. Screen health-care workers with high-risk exposures, regardless of the development of<br/>
	symptoms (as described above), to detect asymptomatic carriers (with PCR testing of<br/>
	nasopharyngeal specimens).<br/>
	d. Consider conducting a sero-prevalence study among health-care workers to detect<br/>
	unrecognized or asymptomatic infections.<br/>
	22<br/>
	e. Develop a guideline to determine when health-care workers can return to their clinical<br/>
	duties.<br/>
	11) To be ready to deal with MERS and other emerging infections, health-care facilities should:<br/>
	a. Increase the availability of negative-pressure isolation rooms in emergency rooms,<br/>
	intensive care units and wards.<br/>
	b. Increase the ratio of trained infection control practitioners to hospital beds to meet<br/>
	international standards.<br/>
	c. Restrict visits by family members and friends to patients with suspected or confirmed<br/>
	infectious diseases.<br/>
	d. Enhance contact tracing among health-care workers and patients exposed to MERS and<br/>
	stratify the risk of their exposure.<br/>
	e. Apply infection control principles in radiology and other ancillary medical departments.<br/>
	f. Consider additional environmental decontamination techniques in high-risk areas.<br/>
	A7. Data management and information sharing<br/>
	Several databases are being used in this outbreak, i.e. for contact tracing, laboratory testing and case<br/>
	report forms. Each database is critical for individual parts of the investigation. However, linking these<br/>
	databases, for example, by national identification number, would give greater power to the analyses.<br/>
	The command and control centre may coordinate these efforts to enable more rigorous analysis and<br/>
	interpretation.<br/>
	1) The following metrics may be calculated daily for internal assessment of the outbreak and a<br/>
	selection may be reported publicly on the government’s website:<br/>
	a. Overall incidence;<br/>
	b. Cases by date of symptom onset and by hospital;<br/>
	c. Number of laboratory-confirmed cases identified from contact lists and specified as<br/>
	"close" or "casual" (i.e. high or low risk);<br/>
	d. Time elapsed between symptom onset and isolation;<br/>
	e. Time elapsed between symptom onset and diagnosis;<br/>
	f. Daily suspected cases under investigation/isolation;<br/>
	g. Number of contacts who are either noncompliant or lost to follow up; and<br/>
	h. Alteration in delivery of health-care services, e.g. postponement of surgical procedures.<br/>
	2) Continue to share viruses and sequence data.<br/>
	3) Encourage continued sharing of information about cases and response measures.<br/>
	4) Participate in global alert, surveillance, clinical and laboratory networks with countries and<br/>
	researchers experienced with MERS to share experiences.<br/>
	A8. Communications<br/>
	1) Target communications more effectively at community level: identify and use chief influencers<br/>
	(e.g. teachers, religious leaders, mothers’ groups).<br/>
	2) Use evidence to develop messaging, such as web and Twitter analytics, impact assessment and<br/>
	sentiment analysis to develop, refine and alter messaging.<br/>
	3) Ensure messaging alignment: engage those likely to be speaking regularly and agree on and<br/>
	provide uniform messaging.<br/>
	4) Use trusted messengers: technical experts and respected community members are more likely to<br/>
	be trusted than political figures.</p></td>
